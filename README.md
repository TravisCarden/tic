# Tic-Tac-Toe

This program is a high school programming project of mine from the year 2000--
probably the first non-trivial application I ever created. It was written in
Pascal and last confirmed to work on Windows 2000. It is posted here entirely
for nostalgia. It is not supported, and it and comes with no warranty of any
kind.
